# 💤 Idle

The idle state provides a baseline for subsequent tests in order to isolate the energy consumption of apps from that of the operating system (OS). For example, a near five-hour test session on a Google Pixel 3a powered by Android 12 showed an average power of 0.527 watts. [See output csv file here](idle_4h48min_Pixel3a.csv)
The same test on a Fairphone3 powered by Android 13 showed an average power of 0.658 watts. [See output csv file here](idle_4h40min_Fairphone3.csv)
