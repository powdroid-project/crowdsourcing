# ðŸ’¤ Baseline

A smartphone/tablet doing nothing special provides a baseline for subsequent tests in order to isolate the energy consumption of apps from that of the operating system (OS). For example, a near five-hour test session on a Google Pixel 3a powered by Android 12 showed an average power of 0.527 watts [csv file](idle_4h48min_Pixel3a.csv).
A similar test session on a Fairphone3 powered by Android 13 showed an average power of 0.658 watts [csv file](idle_4h40min_Fairphone3.csv).
